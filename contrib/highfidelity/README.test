    pyenv virtualenv 3.6.4 elements
    pip install -f requirements.txt


RUN THE TESTS

To ensure that Elements can perform the basic function of building a
blockchain from scratch with signed blocks. Also tests the sanity of our
Elements class implementation, which is used in test_secondary_node.py
tests:

    pytest test_elements_sanity.py -s


To test various use cases involving a master node and a "slave" node
that enables a third-party blockchain exporer but does not enable the
submission of transactions or the signing of blocks:

    pytest test_explorer_node.py -s
